# chicago_bikeshare_en
In this project, I used Python to explore data related to bike share systems for Chicago. I wrote a code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I also created some important functions and plot charts. This project was created by Udacity in their course of Machine Learning &amp; AI foundations.
